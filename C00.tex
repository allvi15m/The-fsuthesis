This chapter proposes a coordinated voltage control method that reduces the use of traditional voltage control devices and utilizes the reactive power generation capabilities of the DG inverters to regulate the distribution system voltage. The proposed algorithm enables cooperation between multiple DGs to control the system voltage. This ensures that the full potential of the DG inverters is utilized before using the traditional devices for voltage regulation. The proposed method also completes its control cycle within a second which makes it suitable for distribution grids containing fast changing DGs. The proposed method has been validated using a distribution feeder model based on a real feeder. A phasor model of the system with the control algorithm was simulated in MATLAB\textsuperscript{\textregistered} Simulink\textsuperscript{\textregistered} using the Simscape Power Systems\textsuperscript{TM} toolbox for validation.
