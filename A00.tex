From the discussion in chapters \ref{TH_intro} and \ref{TH_LR}, it is evident that there is a need for a real-time ESM solution that can optimize the long-term operating costs of a system containing DG and an energy storage (ES) system. This chapter presents an optimum real-time control strategy for such systems. The proposed control strategy takes into account the present and forecasted states of the system, together with the real-time price (RTP).The control approacg uses a graph search algorithm called A*.
