From the discussion in chapter \ref{TH_intro} it is evident that with the integration of DERs in the grid several new challenges are coming into light. To help in the integration of DERs and combat these challenges ADMS and DERMS are being developed. Two significant components of DERMS are voltage regulation and energy management. This chapter focuses on the state of the art research on these two topics. Analysis of research gaps in the areas and novel contribution of the research are also presented. 
\section{Voltage Regulation}
As mentioned in chapter \ref{TH_intro} voltage regulation is one of the primary challenges to be overcome in order to have a high penetration of DERs in the grid. Currently, there are two types of regulation devices available in the system. The first type is the traditional regulation devices (on load tap changers, switched capacitor banks, step voltage regulators ) and the other types are power electronics based regulation devices (DG inverters and distribution static VAR compensators). There needs to be an optimum operation of both to reliably and cost-effectively maintain the voltage at all the nodes of the system. In literature, this problem is defined in two ways. It can be defined as an Optimum voltage regulation problem, or it can be defined as an optimum reactive power dispatch problem. Many alternative methods with different controllable components have been discussed in the literature to solve the problem. The following is a brief discussion of the controllable components which may be used to solve the problem \cite{VC_1}. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Generation curtailment during low demand:} The DGs generation may be curtailed during low demand periods to maintain the system voltage. This would be harmful to the DG owner because the DGs cannot operate in peak condition.
    \item \textbf{Reactive power control (VAR compensation) by reactive compensator:} Reactive VAR compensators placed at strategic points of the system can be used to absorb or inject reactive power.  
    \item \textbf{Area based OLTC (on load tap changer) coordinated voltage control:} The OLTC at the substation can be controlled to maintain voltage.
    \item \textbf{Inverters at DG sites:} The inverters of the DGs can be used similarly to the VAR compensators to inject reactive power or absorb reactive power as needed.
    \item \textbf{Energy storage:} If there are energy storage in the system their charging and discharging operations can be controlled to maintain system voltage.
\end{itemize}

Control methodologies which take into account all the components are a contemporary research topic and they can be divided into two main categories. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Centralized control
    \item Decentralized and distributed control
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Centralized Control}
In this control strategy, every component of the distribution system is controlled from a centralized controller. Proper implementation of these methods requires a robust communication network in the distribution system. The centralized control methods considered here focus on control algorithms that make use of the DG inverters to maintain global voltage. 

An objective function to minimize active power loss in distribution network has been considered in \cite{CE_VC_1}. Reference \cite{CE_VC_2} focuses on reactive power control with an objective of minimizing voltage deviation at each bus according to a reference voltage. In \cite{CE_VC_3} the distribution network has been divided into different subsections to reduce the optimization complexity. In \cite{CE_VC_4} tap operation and system losses in radial distribution network were minimized by coordinating OLTCs and SVCs (static VAR compensators). In \cite{CE_VC_5} the day ahead prediction of DGs were used to aid in the regulation method. A real-time optimum control strategy with vehicle to grid interface is proposed in \cite{CE_VC_6}. Another control strategy utilizing energy storage systems and OLTCS is proposed in \cite{CE_VC_7}.

A centralized control strategy can provide the best performance possible, but it may not be the best solution for the future grid for the following reasons \cite{VC_1}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item They require significant investment in communication assets.
    \item A large number of small scale devices need to be controlled.
    \item There is an increased amount of uncertainty due to faults, electric vehicles, storage units, dynamic loads, variable DGs, restoration, reconfiguration etc.
    \item Increased computation complexity due to a large number of variables.
    \item Does not incorporate plug and play capabilities.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Decentralized and Distributed Control}
Decentralized and distributed control schemes do not have a centralized hub where the control actions are calculated. They consist of multiple controllers which communicate with each other to maintain system stability \cite{DB_VC_1}.  Different decentralized and distributed control schemes are briefly discussed below.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Distributed optimization method:} The optimum voltage control problem can be formulated as a non-convex optimal power flow problem. In these methods, some form of convex relaxation is applied to make the problem convex. Then the centralized convex problem is decomposed to and solved by distributed algorithms \cite{Kyrue}. References  \cite{KUt17,BAR16,BAR161,WZh16} are some of the recent literature using various distributed optimization methods to solve the voltage regulation problem.
    \item \textbf{Decentralized Methods:} In the decentralized method, each area solves its own voltage regulation problem and the solution only affects that area. Both heuristic methods and optimization methods may be used to solve the problems \cite{Kyrue}. \cite{MChss,MBa,XZh16,MNa16,LRe15,EDass} are some recent publications on this method.
    \item \textbf{Distributed Cooperation:} In this scheme, the secondary centralized control interacts with autonomous primary control. This results in a secondary control scheme that substitutes local control \cite{Kyrue}. References \cite{ABi13,FGu15,SAn13,QSh14} are some modern research on this topic.
    \item \textbf{Distributed Adaptive Control:} These methods monitor their performance and self-tunes its input value rather than maintaining a reference value. In \cite{ABi14} the adaptive secondary voltage control is formulated as a tracking synchronization problem. Neural networks were used to model the non-linear inverter dynamics \cite{Kyrue}.
    \item \textbf{Distributed Model Predictive Control:} In this method, the controllers predict their state over a finite time-horizon by gathering information from their neighbors and using the model of the system. In \cite{GLoss} model predictive control is used to minimize the voltage deviation until all the voltages synchronize to a reference value \cite{Kyrue}.
    \item \textbf{Decision Making:} In this method when there is a conflict between multiple objectives a decision maker is used to identify the solution \cite{Kyrue}. Expert-based decision makers are incorporated in smart agents in \cite{HEF12, HEF13}. The agents communicate using a contract net protocol option. The controllers in \cite{MEC13} exchange their constraints to solve a dynamic optimal dispatch problem.
    \item \textbf{Hybrid Methods:} In this case, the distributed control takes over when the local control fails to maintain the system voltage \cite{Kyrue}. Reference \cite{GMo13,YWa16} uses consensus algorithms for distributed control after local control fails. Reference \cite{DRe13} does active curtailment of DG units. In \cite{BAR13} the distributed control requests reactive power compensation from neighboring zones if voltage imbalance cannot be mitigated.
\end{itemize}
An overview of the advantages and disadvantages of the methods mentioned is given in Fig. \ref{fig:DIS_CVC}.

\section{Energy Management}
With real-time pricing and variability of DGs, energy management can play a vital role to decrease the cost of energy. The goal of a modern energy management system would be to optimize the use of energy storage not only based on the current state of the system but also based on the probable future states. The energy management algorithms which deal with both variable DGs and real-time pricing can be divided into two main categories, offline and real-time algorithms \cite{Wen17}. 
\subsection{Offline Algorithms}
The offline optimization algorithms usually optimize energy for a predetermined time horizon based on prediction data. Researchers in \cite{ACh13} use neural network combined with linear programming based multi-objective optimization to optimize the use of several DERs in a microgrid. They also use fuzzy logic based expert system to schedule the use of energy storage. Fig. \ref{fig:OFF_1} shows the microgrid architecture under consideration in this research. The researchers use 24-hour ahead PV forecasting and 1-hour ahead wind energy forecasting to optimize the use of the resources. Although this approach guarantees global optimization, huge computation power is necessary to scale this for larger systems. Also, the optimality of the solution is based on considering perfect prediction.

\begin{figure}[!h]

\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth, angle = 90]{figs/OFF_1.png}
\caption[Microgrid architecture under consideration]{Microgrid architecture under consideration in \cite{ACh13}.}
\label{fig:OFF_1}
\end{figure}

Researchers in \cite{AKh14} propose a microgrid optimization problem which runs the microgrid in islanded mode if enough generation is available and connects to the grid if enough generation is not available in the microgrid or the cost of using the local DERs becomes higher than the grid cost. Fig. \ref{fig:OFF_2}  shows the flowchart of the proposed scheduling model. The problem is defined in two parts. A grid-connected operation master problem a subproblem for islanded operation. First, the master problem determines the optimal scheduling of the available resources with the grid. Then the schedule is passed down to the subproblem to determine the feasibility of the microgrid operation. If the microgrid does not have the capability to pertain to the schedule, it cuts back the deficiencies from the schedule and returns the new schedule to the main problem.  The proposed method schedules the microgrid operation intentional islanding operations a day ahead based on predicted data. This makes the method highly reliant on perfect prediction. \cite{WSh15} presents an off-line method that takes into account the underlying structure of the grid. The researchers propose a scheduling method based on optimum power flow to ensure none of the scheduled states violate system constraints. The system is optimally scheduled taking the help of both a global controller and locally placed distributed controllers. The methods mentioned thus far show significant saving under ideal conditions. However, the reliability on perfect prediction and non-scalable nature of some of the solutions make them impractical for implementation on the actual grid.

\begin{figure}[!h]

\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{figs/OFF_2.png}
\caption[Proposed scheduling model]{Proposed scheduling model  in \cite{AKh14}.}
\label{fig:OFF_2}
\end{figure}

To solve the problem of reliance on perfect prediction some offline algorithms, try to model the uncertainties in day-ahead scheduling and try to develop optimum schedules taking into account the probable uncertainties.
\cite{Has17} uses mixed integer linear programming formulation of the day ahead scheduling of microgrids. The uncertainties are taken into account by calculating multiple solutions based on different predicted seniors. 
The authors in \cite{Yue16} formulate the optimization problem based on the worst case scenario. The solution method considers the most cost from the grid and the least benefits from using local DG resources. The uncertainty of the grid is expressed as set points in Taguchi’s orthogonal array. Then search strategy based on Taguchi’s orthogonal array is used to find the best possible solution cases. Using the worst case to formulate the problem makes the solution robust for all situations. Although this method provides a robust solution always taking into account, the worst scenario makes the solution suboptimal.
\cite{FFa15} uses the mixed inter programming formulation for optimizing the DERs. The uncertainties of the predicted data are taken into account by generating different schedules with risk-averse and risk-neutral options. The different scenarios are stochastically generated based on the risk-based prediction data available. The approach uses stochastic programming to generate the uncertainties as different scenarios. The number of scenarios required to adequately capture the uncertainties usually end up being very large. 





\subsection{Real-Time Algorithms}
There have been advances recently in designing real-time algorithms that optimize the long-term cost of the energy management system taking into account the intermittent nature of the loads and DGs in the grid. \cite{RPa13} Proposes a real-time management process based on a rolling horizon strategy. The algorithm proposed solves a mixed integer linear programming problem in each interval to generate set points for the resources available. The researchers test the algorithm using a microgrid model consisting of PV panel, diesel generator, wind turbine and energy storage system. Fig. \ref{fig:RT_1} shows a block diagram of the proposed method As it can be seen from the diagram the method takes into account historical data, current measurement and weather forecast in the optimization process. The system discussed has to solve a mixed integer linear program on every time interval. This process is computationally intensive and becomes exponentially more complex with the addition of more energy resources.
\begin{figure}[!h]

\caption[A block diagram of proposed energy management system]{A block diagram of proposed energy management system  \cite{RPa13}.}
\label{fig:RT_1}
\end{figure}

 Researchers in \cite{Sun14} use an aggregator to minimize the long-term cost of the grid. Figure 40 shows the top level schematic representation of the control architecture proposed. The solution used Lyapunov optimization to solve the energy management problem in real-time. The method proposed does not consider the actual architecture of the grid and optimizes considering all the components are connected to the same bus. This makes it impractical due to the actual grid having line constraints that cannot be violated.

\caption[Schematic representation of solution method prepossessed]{Schematic representation of solution method prepossessed in \cite{Sun14}.}
\label{fig:RT_2}
\end{figure}

\cite{Men16} formulates the problem as a real-time one leader N-follower Stackelberg game and shows an efficient approach designed to optimize the system based on a demand response scheme. The optimization is performed by creating a virtual electricity trading market where the facility (leader) produces virtual prices of electricity and the resources (followers) compete to buy and sell electricity. The researchers show the existence of unique Stackelberg equilibrium for optimum use of each resource.

In \cite{Tia17}, researchers propose a multi-period AC optimal power flow taking into account the uncertainties of the solar and wind resources to ensure reliable solutions for the distribution system operators. Figure 41 shows the developed method in \cite{Tia17}. In the first stage the algorithm contacts with all the available resources to determine the upper and lower bounds of generation throughout the next day. The upper and lower bounds of the different units are termed as flexibility in the paper. In the second stage which is the real-time operation, the algorithm optimizes in real-time taking into account the flexibility of the available resources.

\caption[Methodology developed]{Methodology developed in \cite{Tia17}.}
\label{fig:RT_3}
\end{figure}

\cite{Wen17} proposes to solve the problem using an online energy management system in real-time using Lyapunov optimization taking into account the physical constraints of the system.
The drawbacks of these methods are that most of them do not take into account the actual distribution system architecture while formulating the problem. Only \cite{Wen17} considers system architecture while optimizing in real-time. However, a lack of prediction based elements makes these methods optimal for short term costs but suboptimal for properly optimizing long term operating cost.





\section{Research Gap}
From the discussion thus far it is evident that there are still many research opportunities in the field of coordinated voltage control and real-time energy management of distribution grids containing DERs. Some of the research gaps in literature are:

\subsection{Coordinated Voltage Regulation Research Gap}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The global control methods discussed are computationally intensive.
    \item Lack of optimum control scheme taking into account all the regulation devices and the variation of DG.
    \item Lack of easily scalable control strategy taking into account system reconfiguration
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Real-Time Energy Management Research Gap}	
\begin{itemize}
    \item Lack of real-time algorithm taking into account variability of DGs, real-time price and system demand to optimize long term cost.
    \item Lack of real-time algorithm taking into account forecasted system states as well as system limitations.
    \item Lack of easily scalable energy management system which takes into account all of the properties mentioned above.
\end{itemize}

section{Contribution}
The efforts invested in the dissertation work at hand mainly aim towards the following:
 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Develop a coordinated voltage control algorithm capable of coordinating inverter interfaced DERs with traditional regulation devices.
    \item Develop a real-time energy management solution that can optimize the use of available energy resources based on present and forecasted data while maintaining system constraints.
\end{enumerate}

At present, a coordinated voltage control algorithm has been developed and validated using off-line simulation. Currently, it is assumed that the algorithm has access to the system voltage magnitude and angles. Moreover, a real-time energy management algorithm to optimize the use of a single grid-connected energy storage has been developed. The algorithm has been validated using controller hardware in the loop simulation.
