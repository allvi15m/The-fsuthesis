From the discussion in chapter \ref{TH_intro}, it is evident that with the integration of DERs in the grid, several new challenges are coming into light. To help in the integration of DERs and combat these challenges, ADMS and DERMS are being developed. Two significant components of DERMS are voltage regulation and energy management. This chapter focuses on the state of the art research on these two topics. Analysis of research gaps in the areas and novel contribution of the research are also presented. 
\section{Voltage Regulation}
As mentioned in chapter \ref{TH_intro}, voltage regulation is one of the primary challenges to be overcome in order to have a high penetration of DERs in the grid. Currently, there are two types of regulation devices available in the system. The first type is the traditional regulation devices (on load tap changers, switched capacitor banks, step voltage regulators) and the other types are power electronics based regulation devices (DG inverters and distribution static VAR compensators). There needs to be an optimum operation of both to reliably and cost-effectively maintain the voltage at all the nodes of the system. In literature, this problem is defined in two ways. It can be defined as an Optimum voltage regulation problem, or it can be defined as an optimum reactive power dispatch problem. Many alternative methods with different controllable components have been discussed in the literature to solve the problem. The following is a brief discussion of the controllable components which may be used to solve the problem \cite{VC_1}. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Generation curtailment during low demand:} The DGs generation may be curtailed during low demand periods to maintain the system voltage. This would be harmful to the DG owner because the DGs cannot operate in peak condition.
    \item \textbf{Reactive power control (VAR compensation) by reactive compensator:} Reactive VAR compensators placed at strategic points of the system can be used to absorb or inject reactive power.  
    \item \textbf{Area based OLTC (on load tap changer) coordinated voltage control:} The OLTC at the substation can be controlled to maintain voltage.
    \item \textbf{Inverters at DG sites:} The inverters of the DGs can be used similarly to the VAR compensators to inject reactive power or absorb reactive power as needed.
    \item \textbf{Energy storage:} If there are energy storage in the system, their charging and discharging operations can be controlled to maintain system voltage.
\end{itemize}

Control methodologies which take into account all the components are still a topic of interest. Some of the recent research on the topic are stated below.

% \subsection{Centralized Control}
% In this control strategy, every component of the distribution system is controlled from a centralized controller. Proper implementation of these methods requires a robust communication network in the distribution system. The centralized control methods considered here focus on control algorithms that make use of the DG inverters to maintain global voltage. 

An objective function to minimize active power loss in distribution network has been considered in \cite{CE_VC_1}. The researchers here use particle swarm optimization with historical data to plan the optimum power flow every 15 minutes. Although this algorithm is shown to plan and coordinate voltage control efficiently this algorithm requires historical data and a good prediction. Also the 15 minutes time interval might be too long to respond to voltage violations effectively. Researchers in \cite{CE_VC_2} focuses on reactive power control with an objective of minimizing voltage deviation at each bus according to a reference voltage. Here the researchers optimize the total system at fixed time intervals to minimize voltage deviation. This approach has similar drawbacks as \cite{CE_VC_1}. Using predictive data to optimize future status of the system may cause less voltage violations but the long and complex computation necessary for the method makes it unsuitable for quickly responding to voltage violations. 
%In \cite{CE_VC_3}, the distribution network has been divided into different subsections to reduce the optimization complexity.
In \cite{CE_VC_4} tap operation and system losses in radial distribution network were minimized by coordinating OLTCs and SVCs (static VAR compensators). In this approach the researchers relaxed the mixed integer nonlinear programming to a continuous non linear programming problem and solved the relaxed problem. The researchers here do not consider the  reactive power generation capabilities of the inverter interfaced DGs.
In \cite{NLR_1}, researchers propose a model predictive control (MPC) based technique where they curtail the DG generation based on the distribution network operator requirements. The researchers assume Voltage magnitude and angle measurements are available to the algorithm. The researchers state that the MPC can be formulated as a quadratic program and solved using commercial solvers.
In \cite{NLR_2} researchers propose a decentralized control scheme where they divide the distribution system into different control zones based on the position of voltage regulators. Each control zone is controlled independently of each other. The coordinated voltage regulation problem is formulated as a minimization problem in this case as well, and the optimum tap position of the voltage regulators are determined using big-bang crunch optimization. The researchers here consider a 15-minute control horizon and assume real-time measurement from the system is available.
The researchers in \cite{NLR_3} propose a coordinated voltage control scheme based on data collected from the distribution system phasor measurement unit (DPMU). Here the researchers propose using a reduced system model by representing the nodes between DPMUs as equivalent $\pi$ or T  lines. Then a rule-based control methodology is used to coordinate voltage regulation.  
Researchers in \cite{NLR_4} present another rule-based approach where they consider a DC microgrid, as well as traditional regulation, devised added to the grid. The researchers validated their algorithm using power hardware in the loop real-time simulation. 
Researchers in \cite{NLR_5} use MPC based approach to control the voltage in a distribution grid by running two different MPCs in parallel in different time scale. The traditional regulation devices in conjunction with the available DG inverters in the system are controlled using a complex MPC formulation. In between the time it takes to solve the complex MPC problem the results of the previous solution is used to optimize the use of available fast responding DERs in the grid. This allows for a fast time scale control to optimize the system in between slower time scale control actions. The slow time scale control action is performed every 60 minutes and the fast time scale control action is performed every minute. The researchers assume system data is available from SCADA in this case. The method mentioned here uses mixed integer programming, and the convergence of the problem depends on the giving it a proper starting criterion. Which means if the initial conditions are far from the actual conduit of the grid the algorithm will not converge. This makes the approach vulnerable to failure from bad data.
Researchers in \cite{NLR_6} use optimum power flow to solve the voltage regulation problem. They use a distributed control approach called fast distributed optimal reactive power flow algorithm. The algorithm uses local controllers or agents at DG nodes which operate based on information available from neighboring nodes. The formulation only deals with reactive power supplied by DG inverters and do not consider coordinating with traditional regulation devices. 
In \cite{NLR_7}, a control strategy to coordinate the traditional regulation devices with grid-connected microgrid is proposed. The test system used in this study is a four bus system with three buses containing microgrids. The problem is formulated as an MPC and solved using a cooperative distributed MPC strategy. They show coordination between the connected microgrids, capacitor banks, and OLTC. The microgrids are able to maintain the required voltage at their point of common coupling (PCC).
In \cite{NLR_8}, researchers propose a control strategy based on a hybrid approach where local controllers maintain voltage using volt-var control. Then a centralized controller further refines the local controls based on an MPC formulation. They assume system data of all the nodes are available. This allows faster local correction in seconds while the global centralized MPC refines the solution every tens of seconds.
Researchers in \cite{NLR_9} propose a multi-objective pareto front optimization based technique to optimize the voltage regulation. They use genetic algorithm (GA) to determine a set of non dominated solutions offline. This step can take hours to perform. Then knowledge based local search (KBLS) is done on the reduced solution space achieved from the GA to get the solution based on current objective. If current objective is lowest cost of operation the KBLS looks for the solution with the least cost. if the current objective is fast voltage recovery then the KBLS will look for a solution that is within the regulation limits. This allows for creating reduced solution spaces offline and then the use of KBLS online to find the solution based on system operator needs. The researcher here show numerical simulation to verify the proposed method.
In \cite{NLR_10} researchers propose a coordinated control scheme that take into account both fast changing and slow changing operations. The researchers here propose using model reduction of the distribution grid. Here they represent the distribution grid elements between regulation devices and VSC connected DGs into equivalent circuit models. Then the reduced model is used to verify the effectiveness of the optimization. The researchers here use a sensitivity analysis based technique to coordinate the system voltage.



%IN \cite{CE_VC_5}, the day ahead prediction of DGs were used to aid in the regulation method. Another control strategy utilizing energy storage systems and OLTCS is proposed in \cite{CE_VC_7}.

% % A centralized control strategy can provide the best performance possible, but it may not be the best solution for the future grid for the following reasons \cite{VC_1}:
% % \begin{itemize}
% %     \item They require significant investment in communication assets.
% %     \item A large number of small scale devices need to be controlled.
% %     \item There is an increased amount of uncertainty due to faults, electric vehicles, storage units, dynamic loads, variable DGs, restoration, reconfiguration etc.
% %     \item Increased computation complexity due to a large number of variables.
% %     \item Does not incorporate plug and play capabilities.
% % \end{itemize}

% \subsection{Decentralized and Distributed Control}
% Decentralized and distributed control schemes do not have a centralized hub where the control actions are calculated. They consist of multiple controllers which communicate with each other to maintain system stability \cite{DB_VC_1}.  Different decentralized and distributed control schemes are briefly discussed below.

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{Distributed optimization method:} The optimum voltage control problem can be formulated as a non-convex optimal power flow problem. In these methods, some form of convex relaxation is applied to make the problem convex. Then the centralized convex problem is decomposed to and solved by distributed algorithms \cite{Kyrue}. References  \cite{KUt17,BAR16,BAR161,WZh16} are some of the recent literature using various distributed optimization methods to solve the voltage regulation problem.
%     \item \textbf{Decentralized Methods:} In the decentralized method, each area solves its own voltage regulation problem and the solution only affects that area. Both heuristic methods and optimization methods may be used to solve the problems \cite{Kyrue}. \cite{MChss,MBa,XZh16,MNa16,LRe15,EDass} are some recent publications on this method.
%     \item \textbf{Distributed Cooperation:} In this scheme, the secondary centralized control interacts with autonomous primary control. This results in a secondary control scheme that substitutes local control \cite{Kyrue}. References \cite{ABi13,FGu15,SAn13,QSh14} are some modern research on this topic.
%     \item \textbf{Distributed Adaptive Control:} These methods monitor their performance and self-tunes its input value rather than maintaining a reference value. In \cite{ABi14} the adaptive secondary voltage control is formulated as a tracking synchronization problem. Neural networks were used to model the non-linear inverter dynamics \cite{Kyrue}.
%     \item \textbf{Distributed Model Predictive Control:} In this method, the controllers predict their state over a finite time-horizon by gathering information from their neighbors and using the model of the system. In \cite{GLoss} model predictive control is used to minimize the voltage deviation until all the voltages synchronize to a reference value \cite{Kyrue}.
%     \item \textbf{Decision Making:} In this method, when there is a conflict between multiple objectives a decision maker is used to identify the solution \cite{Kyrue}. Expert-based decision makers are incorporated in smart agents in \cite{HEF12, HEF13}. The agents communicate using a contract net protocol option. The controllers in \cite{MEC13} exchange their constraints to solve a dynamic optimal dispatch problem.
%     \item \textbf{Hybrid Methods:} In this case, the distributed control takes over when the local control fails to maintain the system voltage \cite{Kyrue}. Reference \cite{GMo13,YWa16} uses consensus algorithms for distributed control after local control fails. Reference \cite{DRe13} does active curtailment of DG units. In \cite{BAR13} the distributed control requests reactive power compensation from neighboring zones if voltage imbalance cannot be mitigated.

\section{Energy Management}
With real-time pricing and variability of DGs, energy management can play a vital role to decrease the cost of energy. The goal of a modern energy management system would be to optimize the use of energy storage not only based on the current state of the system but also based on the probable future states. The energy management algorithms which deal with both variable DGs and real-time pricing can be divided into two main categories, offline and real-time algorithms \cite{Wen17}. 
\subsection{Offline Algorithms}
The offline optimization algorithms usually optimize energy for a predetermined time horizon based on prediction data. Researchers in \cite{ACh13} use neural network combined with linear programming based multi-objective optimization to optimize the use of several DERs in a microgrid. They also use fuzzy logic based expert system to schedule the use of energy storage. Fig. \ref{fig:OFF_1} shows the microgrid architecture under consideration in this research. The researchers use 24-hour ahead PV forecasting and 1-hour ahead wind energy forecasting to optimize the use of the resources. Although this approach guarantees global optimization, huge computation power is necessary to scale this for larger systems. Also, the optimality of the solution is based on considering perfect prediction.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth, angle = 90]{figs/OFF_1.png}
\caption[Microgrid architecture under consideration]{Microgrid architecture under consideration in \cite{ACh13}.}
\label{fig:OFF_1}
\end{figure}

Researchers in \cite{AKh14} propose a microgrid optimization problem which runs the microgrid in islanded mode if enough generation is available and connects to the grid if enough generation is not available in the microgrid or the cost of using the local DERs becomes higher than the grid cost. Fig. \ref{fig:OFF_2}  shows the flowchart of the proposed scheduling model. The problem is defined in two parts. A grid-connected operation master problem a subproblem for islanded operation. First, the master problem determines the optimal scheduling of the available resources with the grid. Then the schedule is passed down to the subproblem to determine the feasibility of the microgrid operation. If the microgrid does not have the capability to pertain to the schedule, it cuts back the deficiencies from the schedule and returns the new schedule to the main problem.  The proposed method schedules the microgrid operation intentional islanding operations a day ahead based on predicted data. This makes the method highly reliant on perfect prediction. \cite{WSh15} presents an off-line method that takes into account the underlying structure of the grid. The researchers propose a scheduling method based on optimum power flow to ensure none of the scheduled states violate system constraints. The system is optimally scheduled taking the help of both a global controller and locally placed distributed controllers. The methods mentioned thus far show significant saving under ideal conditions. However, the reliability on perfect prediction and non-scalable nature of some of the solutions make them impractical for implementation on the actual grid.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{figs/OFF_2.png}
\caption[Proposed scheduling model]{Proposed scheduling model  in \cite{AKh14}.}
\label{fig:OFF_2}
\end{figure}

To solve the problem of reliance on perfect prediction some offline algorithms, try to model the uncertainties in day-ahead scheduling and try to develop optimum schedules taking into account the probable uncertainties.
\cite{Has17} uses mixed integer linear programming formulation of the day ahead scheduling of microgrids. The uncertainties are taken into account by calculating multiple solutions based on different predicted seniors. 
The authors in \cite{Yue16} formulate the optimization problem based on the worst case scenario. The solution method considers the most cost from the grid and the least benefits from using local DG resources. The uncertainty of the grid is expressed as set points in Taguchi’s orthogonal array. Then search strategy based on Taguchi’s orthogonal array is used to find the best possible solution cases. Using the worst case to formulate the problem makes the solution robust for all situations. Although this method provides a robust solution always taking into account, the worst scenario makes the solution suboptimal.
\cite{FFa15} uses the mixed inter programming formulation for optimizing the DERs. The uncertainties of the predicted data are taken into account by generating different schedules with risk-averse and risk-neutral options. The different scenarios are stochastically generated based on the risk-based prediction data available. The approach uses stochastic programming to generate the uncertainties as different scenarios. The number of scenarios required to adequately capture the uncertainties usually end up being very large. 

\subsection{Real-Time Algorithms}
There have been advances recently in designing real-time algorithms that optimize the long-term cost of the energy management system, taking into account the intermittent nature of the loads and DGs in the grid. \cite{RPa13} Proposes a real-time management process based on a rolling horizon strategy. The algorithm proposed solves a mixed integer linear programming problem in each interval to generate setpoints for the resources available. The researchers test the algorithm using a microgrid model consisting of a PV panel, diesel generator, wind turbine and energy storage system. Fig. \ref{fig:RT_1} shows a block diagram of the proposed method. As it can be seen from the diagram, the method takes into account historical data, current measurement and weather forecast in the optimization process. The system discussed has to solve a mixed integer linear program on every time interval. This process is computationally intensive and becomes exponentially more complex with the addition of more energy resources.
\begin{figure}[!h]

\includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth]{figs/RT_1.png}
\caption[A block diagram of proposed energy management system]{A block diagram of proposed energy management system  \cite{RPa13}.}
\label{fig:RT_1}
\end{figure}

 Researchers in \cite{Sun14} use an aggregator to minimize the long-term cost of the grid. Figure 40 shows the top level schematic representation of the control architecture proposed. The solution used Lyapunov optimization to solve the energy management problem in real-time. The method proposed does not consider the actual architecture of the grid and optimizes considering all the components are connected to the same bus. This makes it impractical due to the actual grid having line constraints that cannot be violated.

\caption[Schematic representation of solution method prepossessed]{Schematic representation of solution method prepossessed in \cite{Sun14}.}
\label{fig:RT_2}
\end{figure}

\cite{Men16} formulates the problem as a real-time one leader N-follower Stackelberg game and shows an efficient approach designed to optimize the system based on a demand response scheme. The optimization is performed by creating a virtual electricity trading market where the facility (leader) produces virtual prices of electricity and the resources (followers) compete to buy and sell electricity. The researchers show the existence of unique Stackelberg equilibrium for optimum use of each resource.

In \cite{Tia17}, researchers propose a multi-period AC optimal power flow taking into account the uncertainties of the solar and wind resources to ensure reliable solutions for the distribution system operators. Figure 41 shows the developed method in \cite{Tia17}. In the first stage, the algorithm contacts with all the available resources to determine the upper and lower bounds of generation throughout the next day. The upper and lower bounds of the different units are termed as flexibility in the paper. In the second stage, which is the real-time operation, the algorithm optimizes in real-time taking into account the flexibility of the available resources.

\caption[Methodology developed]{Methodology developed in \cite{Tia17}.}
\label{fig:RT_3}
\end{figure}

\cite{Wen17} proposes to solve the problem using an online energy management system in real-time using Lyapunov optimization taking into account the physical constraints of the system.
The drawbacks of these methods are that most of them do not take into account the actual distribution system architecture while formulating the problem. Only \cite{Wen17} considers system architecture while optimizing in real-time. However, a lack of prediction based elements makes these methods optimal for short term costs but suboptimal for properly optimizing long term operating cost.


\section{Research Gap}
From the discussion thus far, it is evident that there are still many research opportunities in the field of coordinated voltage control and real-time energy management of distribution grids containing DERs. Some of the research gaps in the literature are:

\subsection{Coordinated voltage control research gap}
The problem of coordinating the traditional regulation devices with the grid-connected DERs to regulate distribution system voltage is still being actively researched. There are novel solutions proposed, but they suffer from one or more of the limitations discussed below:
\begin{itemize}
    \item They consider that the voltage angle, magnitude, and real \& reactive power from all the nodes are available.
    \item They simplify the system based on the location of measurement devices which may lead to voltage violation inside the simplified sections.
    \item They only consider DERs or traditional voltage regulation devices to control the system voltage. Which loses the potential benefit of coordinating between DERs and traditional regulation devices.
    \item Some of the proposed solutions takes tens of seconds to minutes to determine the control action. This might not be fast enough response in systems with fast-changing DGs.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Energy management research gap}

    
%     \item Real-time energy management research gap: With the increasing amount of variable DGs being added to the grid, it is becoming very difficult to have accurate long term prediction of grid status. The presently available solutions either use present grid status to do real-time control or use day ahead scheduling or use a mix of both to do energy management. There is still the need for an energy management scheme that can optimize system status in real-time with a continuously updating forecast. 
% \end{itemize}

\section{Contribution}
The efforts invested in the dissertation work at hand mainly aim towards the following:
 
\subsection{Development of coordinated voltage control algorithm}
A coordinated voltage control algorithm will be developed, which can make use of the reactive power generation capabilities of the inverter interfaced DERs and coordinate these resources with the existing traditional regulation devices. For this purpose, a solution methodology combining the Voltage Sensitivity Analysis \cite{Th_ali} and Electrical Distance Calculation \cite{Alvi3} concepts will be explored.

Major work under this task:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Design of proposed voltage control algorithm 
    \item Implementation of voltage control model in centralized or decentralized network typologies
    \item Compare performance of the proposed model with traditional voltage regulation scheme
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Development of real-time energy management system}
An energy management system that takes into account the physical system constraints while optimizing the use of available energy resources not only based on the current price but also based on the forecasted price will be developed. This part will be implemented by dividing the energy storage into separate states and creating a graph taking into account the system constraints. The solution of the energy management problem will be developed using a combination of the traditional optimal dispatch of generation solution, using the Linear programming model with DC power flow, with a graph search solution obtained from the utilization of the A* algorithm designed to find the optimal and most cost effective solution for dispatching available energy resources taking into account not only the present status of the system, but also the future forecasting values of the energy prices, load demand, and generation.
To accommodate the forecasted data into decision making. The energy storage (ES) capability of the system is divided into discrete states of charge (SOC). Then a graph is constructed to represent the states of charges with respect to time. Each edge of the graph will have a total cost. The total cost will be calculated, taking into account the economic dispatch of the resources available in the system. After the graph is constructed, A* search algorithm will be used to find the optimal path.

Major work under this task:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Design of proposed A* star algorithm model 
    \item Integration of forecasting information
    \item Compare performance of the proposed model with other available schemes.
\end{itemize}


At present, a coordinated voltage control algorithm has been developed and validated using off-line simulation. Currently, it is assumed that the algorithm has access to the system voltage magnitude and angles. Moreover, a real-time energy management algorithm to optimize the use of a single grid-connected energy storage has been developed. The algorithm has been validated using controller hardware in the loop simulation.
