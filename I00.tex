With the growing population, and increasing modernization and industrialization, the global demand is estimated to increase drastically, more than triple by the ends of this century \cite{INTRO1}. The present power industry is faced with the great challenge of balancing power generation with this increasing demand. In 2017 an estimated 4 trillion kilowatt hours of electricity was generated to meet the demands of the United States \cite{EIA2018}. Table \ref{tab:IN1} shows the percentage shares of the different sources of generation in the U.S. for the year 2017. The data used in the Table is collected from \cite{EIA2018}.

From the table \ref{tab:IN1} it is evident that the current energy sources mostly rely on natural gas and coal. These are resources that do not renew at a sufficient rate to allow sustainable extraction. The increased power demand combined with the non-renewable nature of the energy resources and their adverse effect on the environment necessitates the incorporation of new and alternative resources to meet the future demand. This has been a major drive for renewable distributed energy resource (DER) integration into the grid \cite{khan2009review,bignucolo2008radial,series2009microgrids}. With the growth in power demand the penetration of distributed energy resource in the distribution system is rising. This trend of adding energy resources in the distribution system is changing the current infrastructure of modern power systems. Fig. \ref{fig:NEW_GRID} shows this transformation of the power grid and what it might look like in the near future. 

\begin{figure}[!h]

\label{fig:NEW_GRID}
\end{figure}

With the integration of DERs power is no longer only generated in bulk at generation facility and then through transmission and distribution supplied to the consumer. DERs make it possible to generate power near the demand. This increases system stability and reduces system loss as power does not need to travel far to reach the source. DERs can be divided into distributed generation (DG) and distributed energy storage (DES). 

%\section{Distributed Generation Technologies}
Distributed generation is an approach that employs appropriate small and medium scale electricity generation resources near the consumer. Non-renewable fuel based distributed generation technologies and dispatchable renewable distributed generation has been a part of the grid for many years. In recent years the incorporation of variable renewable energy based DG has increased significantly. There are mainly two types of variable renewable DGs used in the distribution grid.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Solar Energy Based DGs
    \item Wind Energy Based DGs
\end{enumerate}
Besides these, biomass,small scale hydro and combined heat and power are some of the prominent distributed generation plants being added to the grid. Fig. \ref{fig:GROWTH_EIA} shows the current trend as well as the projected future of electricity generation by source. It is evident form the figure that renewable generation sources will keep on increasing in the grid.

\caption[Us electricity generation by energy source.]{Us electricity generation by energy source.\cite{EIA2018}}
\label{fig:GROWTH_EIA}
\end{figure}

%\section{Grid Energy Storage}
Energy storage can provide backup power and increase grid stability by mitigating the effects of variable renewable generation in the grid. It can also be used to store energy during relatively low demand and release it back during high demand periods. There are various energy storing methods currently used in the grid, including \cite{GE1}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Pumped Hydro:} In times of low demand and high generation electricity is used to pump water in a storage reservoir. During high demand the stored water is used to generate power.
    \item \textbf{Compressed Air:} During low demand electricity is used to store compressed air up to 1,000 Psi. Then it is used to generate during low demand.
    \item \textbf{Batteries:} Batteries store electricity in the form om chemical energy. Similar to the previous approaches electricity is stored during high demand and released during low demand.
    \item \textbf{Flywheels:} Flywheel use electricity to store rotational kinetic energy. During low demand a motor is used to rotate the flywheel and store kinetic energy. During high demand this kinetic energy is used to rotate a generator and produce power.
    \item \textbf{Thermal Storage:} During times of low demand electricity is used to store thermal energy. Then during high demand, the stored energy is used for heating and cooling applications.
\end{itemize}

As of June 2016, the U.S. had over 21.6 GW of rated power in energy storage. Most of the projects are Electro-chemical energy storage projects. Pumped hydro storage represents the majority capacity of the currently available storage. Fig. \ref{fig:ES_INCREASE} shows the growth of energy storage installation in the grid. Between the years 2008 – 2016 the U.S. has installed 1.17 GW new energy storage capacity in the grid.

\section{Issues Due to High Penetration of DERs in Distribution system}
The current power grid was designed to accommodate unidirectional power flow. This was an efficient design to distribute power from central transmission to distribution feeders to the loads \cite{HPPV}.  With the introduction of DGs, the traditional design has to face some new challenges. The existing distribution system components were not designed to accommodate bidirectional power flow \cite{HPPV}. Therefore, there are concerns arising regarding the increased penetration of DGs. This is a very important research field. This field is getting more attention as more DGs are incorporated into the grid. 

The potential impact of integration of DGs in the distribution system is affected by many different parameters. The location and rating of the DG, the regulation and protection equipment present in the system, the stiffness of the feeder etc. play a major role in the impact of the DG. Moreover, the variability of the non-dispatchable variable DGs also play a significant role in the negative impact the DGs might have on the feeder. This chapter will present a review of the potential impacts of DG integration, mostly focusing on voltage regulation issues.

\subsection{General Potential Impacts}
There are a lot of potential impacts that may happen in a distribution grid with a high penetration of DGs. This brief review presents a small part of the impacts. In this section, some of the general system level impacts are stated with references that deeply explain the phenomenon. Some of the impacts may be:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Voltage ride through. \cite{GPI1}
    \item Tripping of multiple DGs.\cite{GP2}
    \item Reverse power flow causing equipment malfunction. \cite{GP3}
    \item Resonance caused by multiple inverter output capacitance. \cite{GP4}
    \item DC injection. \cite{GP5}
    \item Protection system coordination. \cite{GP3}
    \item Line overloading. \cite{GP6}
    \item High penetration of DG can have impact on transformer insulation. \cite{GP4}
\end{itemize}
The effects of DG integration can appear at any level of penetration but as the DG generation start to overcome the demand of the nearby loads the effects start to become more prominent \cite{Th_ali}.

\subsection{Technical potential impact}
Besides these there are some technical potential impacts that need to be considered.

\subsubsection{Impacts on Power Quality:}
“Power quality is a set of electrical boundaries that allow a piece of equipment to function in its intended manner without significant loss of performance or life expectancy” \cite{TPI1}. Another definition according to IEEE standard 1159 – 2009 defines power quality as “a wide variety of electromagnetic (EM) phenomena that characterize the voltage and current at a given time and at a given location on the power system” \cite{TPI2}.  Power quality has become a very important topic in recent years as the use of power electronic devices in the grid has increased. These have introduced the following types of power issues in the system.

According to IEEE standard 1159 – 2009, electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) is defined as “the ability of a device, equipment or system to function satisfactorily in its electromagnetic environment without introducing intolerable electromagnetic disturbances to anything in that environment”.  EMC has been accepted by the international community of International Electro-technical Commission (IEC) to describe power quality phenomena \cite{TPI2}. Both the standard IEEE 1159 – 2009 and the IEC 61000-4-7 standard give detailed description of different electromagnetic (EM) phenomena pertaining to power quality. The IEEE 1159 – 2009 categorize these phenomena into seven main categories and that further branch into subcategories as stated below:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Transients
    \item Short-duration root-mean-square (rms) variations
    \item Long duration rms variations
    \item Imbalance in steady state
    \item Waveform distortion
    \item Voltage fluctuations 
    \item Power frequency variations
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Islanding}
Islanding or more specifically unintentional islanding is a possible threat of DG integration. Islanding occurs when a section of the feeder is isolated and the DG present in that section continues to feed the local load. This can lead to some negative effects. If the protection system in the distribution network is designed to reestablish the circuit after clearance of temporary fault the active DG might be reconnected to the grid out of phase. This can cause damage to the DG and equipment on the feeder \cite{ILAND_1}. There is also the risk of workers working on an unintentionally islanded system without knowing the system in energized \cite{ILAND_1}. Additionally, the utility cannot control the power quality of the DGs in the islanded system. The protection system in place in the islanded system may not be coordinated properly to work without the presence of the grid. This can lead to permanent faults in the islanded sections with lower current values than usual because the protection coordination did not respond \cite{ILAND_2}.

\subsubsection{Voltage regulation}
The impact of DG on voltage variation is mostly prevalent in distribution networks. The distribution networks are radial in nature. Let us consider the radial feeder shown in 
Fig. \ref{fig:VR1} In \cite{VR1} a study was done inserting PV system in different nodes along the feeder. Fig. \ref{fig:VR2} Shows how the voltage level is affected by integrating a PV plant at different positions of the feeder. It can be seen that PV addition near the end of the line causes a greater disturbance on the line voltage compared to PV inserted close to the substation. So depending on the capacity and the point of integration, a DG can take the voltage limit outside standards such as those in ANSI C84.1 and IEEE 1547 \cite{VR2}.

\caption[Node voltage of PV accessing at different positions]{Node voltage of PV accessing at different positions.\cite{VR1}}
\label{fig:VR2}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{System protection impacts}
The protection system of the distribution grid has been designed for unidirectional power flow. The integration of DG will require upgrading the protection system for better protection coordination. Usually, distribution systems employ protection schemes that consist of fuses, circuit breakers, sectionalizes, and automatic restoration devices that are coordinated in the load direction to operate with a minimum number of customers affected \cite{PRO1}. This coordination does not account for the integration of DG in the system. The integration of DG introduces more sources in the feeder to contribute to the fault current. Depending on the fault location, rating of DG and protection system installed, many problems could arise. Some of the possible problems are listed below.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Fault level modification
    \item Blinding of Protection
    \item Sympathetic tripping
    \item Reduction in reach of distance relay
    \item Sensitivity reduction of high impedance fault detection
\end{enumerate}
Detailed analysis of the problems can be found in \cite{PRO2}.

\section{ADMS (Advanced Distribution Management System)}
From the previous discussion it is evident that increased DER penetration is bringing some complex problems to be solved. To combat these emerging issues new technology is being added to the aging infrastructure of the traditional power grid. These new technologies are known as "smart grid" technologies. The future evolving grid or “smart grid” has to incorporate information technology, communication technology and advanced control with power engineering. Another major aspect of the smart grid is control automation. The smart grid has to be self -healing and capable of maintaining system stability in case of system change and anomalies. And last but not least the grid of the future has to enable its stakeholders to realize new ways of performing energy transactions across the system while making sure it is financially viable and beneficial for both parties \cite{SG1}. To maximize the utilization of these new resources and data available a proper management system is required. The concept of ADMS (advanced distribution management system) is introduced to handle this task. The concept of ADMS is still an evolving topic and different sources define the components present in an ADMS system differently. However irrespective of the internal architecture there are three major functions a modern ADMS system should be able to perform \cite{ADMS_1}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Monitor and operate: An ADMS system should be capable of wide area monitoring and operations. Utilities use SCADA systems to monitor the state of the grid from a central location. SCADA provides the current status of different protection systems, alarms and metering devices to aid the operator in system operation.
    \item Analyze and Optimize: Analysis and optimization is done using the distribution network applications included with the ADMS. The included applications vary between different ADMS providers. The main purpose here is to optimize the use of available resources without jeopardizing system stability.
    \item Track and Restore: With the integration of DERs and introduction of reverse power flow the fault characteristics of a distribution grid has changed drastically. Proper identification of fault location very complex problem. ADMS solutions provide different components like outage management system, auto system restoration system, fault identification system etc. to aid the utilities in fault detection and system restoration.
\end{itemize}
As the ADMS is an evolving technology, the ADMS architecture is defined differently by various sources. Fig. \ref{fig:ADMS_ARCH} shows the ADMS architecture proposed by the United States department of energy. The shaded region represents the sections which are still being actively developed and researched. Integrating these aspects with the existing management system is the major challenge of designing a modern ADMS system. Short descriptions of the different components of the ADMS architecture proposed by the United States department of energy are given below \cite{ADMS_2}:

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth]{figs/ADMS_ARCH.png}
\caption[ADMS architecture]{ADMS architecture. \cite{ADMS_2}}
\label{fig:ADMS_ARCH}
\end{figure}

 \begin{itemize}
     \item \textbf{AMI:} AMI represents the advanced metering infrastructure. The AMI is responsible for aggregating different measured data and sending it to the utility.
     \item \textbf{DRM:} DRM stands for dispatchable resource management. It chooses the most cost-effective way to modulate the traditional dispatchable resources to meet the current demand.
     \item \textbf{OMS:} The Outage Management System is in charge of managing the process of restoration after an outage has occurred in the grid. It is in charge of detecting incidents and automatically reconfiguring the network to have the least outage possible. It also deals with customer calls and crew management to restore service.
     \item \textbf{GIS:} A geographical information system(GIS) lets the utility analyze, interpret and visualize data based on geographical location. This helps the operators in real-time monitoring of the system. It also helps the operators to understand patterns and trends in the system.
     \item \textbf{SCADA:} The purpose of SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) is to monitor and control the system based on the data collected from different sources. SCADA is used for high level supervision and management.
     \item \textbf{DMS:} DMS stands for Distribution Management System. This is used for managing different resources at distribution level.
     \item \textbf{DERMS:} DERMS stand for Distributed Energy Resource Management System. DERMS work in conjunction with the DMS to ensure the efficient use of DERs in the distribution system. It can be viewed as a subsystem of the DMS in charge of DERs.
     \item \textbf{Microgrid:} Microgrids are entities capable of operating self-sufficiently with or without grid connection. Microgrids can be owned by the utility or another third party. The microgrids can be operated as a self-sufficient zone in times of high demand and faults.
 \end{itemize}

\subsection{DERMS (Distributed Energy Resource Management System)}
As this report focuses on components of DERMS this concept is explained in more detail. The conventional power grid had an unpredictable and varying load profile. To counter this the traditional grid used the dispatchability of traditional power plants and spinning reserves to maintain reliable power flow. It is also clear from the discussions in chapter 1 that the integration of distributed generation resources in the distribution system is increasing rapidly. As variable DG integration increases in the grid, the unpredictability of the grid rises drastically. The traditional approach of keeping spinning reserves are not only expensive but also inefficient to deal with this modern varying grid. Storage technology can play a key role in decreasing the variability of the grid [73]. With modern advance in energy storage, utilities are considering deploying energy storage rated from 2kWh to 50 MWh in the distribution level [74]. Medium to small scale energy storage deployed near the consumer end lets the utilities provide better voltage control, renewable integration and reduced distribution losses while providing them the means to absorb fluctuation in prices and load. Moreover, with real-time pricing, the consumer can optimize the use of their own energy storage and minimize electricity cost by taking advantage of the fluctuating price [75], [76]. [77]
Optimizing the use of energy resources can lead to a lower cost. But grid voltage stability and constraints cannot be compromised to gain the optimal solution. As discussed in chapter 2 integration of DGs produce challenges for maintaining system voltage stability. Another major concern is the new complexities that arise in properly protecting the system. As mentioned in chapter 2 the traditional protection schemes are not adequate in maintaining optimal system protection. 
So an all around distributed energy resource management solution should take into account the system architecture and protection considerations while optimizing the use of available resources.
To manage these new DERs at the distribution level the concept DERMS (Distributed Energy Resource Management System
) has been introduced. Fig. \ref{fig:DERMS_ARCH} shows functions of a DERMS system. 

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth]{figs/DERMS_ARCH.png}
\caption[Functions of DERMS.]{Functions of DERMS. \cite{DERMS_1}}
\label{fig:DERMS_ARCH}
\end{figure}

The function of the DERMS is to help the utility to optimally control the DERs to increase grid stability and lower costs. It also must deal with the unique characteristics of faults caused in the distribution level by increased DG penetration. The problems the DERMS has to solve can be subdivided into three categories voltage regulation, energy management and protection. The purpose of this research is to develop novel methods which will help in the voltage regulation and the energy management aspects of DERMS.
