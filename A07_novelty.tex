The novelty of the research is as follows
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implemented a real-time ESM algorithm capable of considering the future as well as present status of the system.
    \item The algorithm finishes computation relatively quickly. It responded within two seconds in the CHIL testing while using the relatively inexpensive hardware specifications shown in table \ref{tab:PC}.
    \item The algorithm is capable of considering different pricing schemes.
    \item The algorithm is easily scalable. The discretization and prediction horizon can be easily scaled to incorporate various needs.
    \item The algorithm is designed in python 2.7 making it easily deployable in a variety of hardware without the need of any proprietary software.
\end{itemize}
