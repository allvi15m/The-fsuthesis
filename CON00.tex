In this prospectus report, the potential impacts of DER (distributed energy resource) integration on the distribution network has been reviewed. Moreover, the challenges of coordinating the system voltage regulation and optimally managing system energy under a real-time pricing scheme have also been explored. The reviews lead to the identification of gaps in the current methods of voltage regulation and optimum energy management. Consequently, two algorithms were proposed that would help in the integration of DERs into the grid.

A coordinated voltage control algorithm based on the concepts of electrical distance calculation and voltage sensitivity analysis has been developed and presented. The algorithm proposed, has the ability to coordinate the reactive power reference points for the distributed generation and traditional voltage regulation devices located along the feeder, taking into account their potential impacts on the entire system. By using this approach, a reduction in the use of traditional regulation devices can be achieved and the voltage profiles along the network can be controlled for the most part by just using the already existing DG inverters present on the network. The planned additions to this work are as follows.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Develop a state estimation technique which can determine the system voltage angle from real and reactive power readings.
    \item Perform real-time validation of developed algorithm
\end{itemize}

Moreover, a novel energy management system aimed to determine the optimal operation of a single grid connected DS has been proposed. The management scheme is designed to optimize the charging and discharging of grid-connected energy storage by formulating the problem as a graph search and solving the graph search using the A* search algorithm. The A* based ESM is tested using real data collected from the SUNGRIN project, NYISO, and PG\&E. It also considers both a net metering scenario and a different sell back price scenario where the buying price of energy is different from the selling price.  The planned additions to this work are as follows.

\begin{itemize}
    \item develop an algorithm capable of dealing with multiple sources while maintaining system constraints.
    \item Perform real-time validation with multiple sources.
\end{itemize}
